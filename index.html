  <h2>Denmark</h2>

              Denmark is my favorite country that I have visited. I was lucky enough to spend a semester there my junior year of college and I can easily say it was the best semester of college. Copenhagen is a beautiful city that has many amazing things to explore. The picture to the left is of Nyhavn, the old port of Copenhagen. The buildings lining the water are all painted different colors, creating a breathtaking scene to enjoy a Carlsberg. Skål!

    <h2>Hungary</h2>

                Hungary is my second favorite country I have visited. The reason why I enjoyed Hungary so much was because I had low expectations on my way to Budapest. Boy was I wrong. Budapest boasts some of the most amazing bath houses in the world and a party scene that is second to none. My friends and I stayed in a very cool hostile, broke the world record for the longest Jager Bomb train, and climbed Gellért Hill. The views from the top were incredible.

                  I have visited the UK a number of times and I have enjoyed each trip immensely. London of course is one of the most prominent European cities rich in history and tourist attractions. My favorite part of the UK was all of the smaller towns I got to visit. York, Bath, and Edinburgh are all unique cities with different things to offer.
